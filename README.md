Part 1
=================
The changes to the project Gutenberg HTML files are as follows:

1) The addition of the line `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Cormorant+Garamond" rel="stylesheet">` to the head in order to import the serif font I used to style the document.

2) The addition of the line `<link rel="stylesheet" href="gutenberg.css">` to the head in order to import the .css file I used to style the HTML files.

Both these additions were made at the very end of the head tag in order to overwrite the style settings in the HTML files
